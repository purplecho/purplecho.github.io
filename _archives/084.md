alt: In the left foreground a pristine food can labelled “baked beans” sits on the dirt. In the right mid ground, a hand sinks in the dirt up to the elbow. Small maggots crawl from the dirt up the arm. In the background, from left to right, a line of shopping bags that get progressively more rotten and decayed. The words “TMA 84 Possessive” float in the top left corner.
