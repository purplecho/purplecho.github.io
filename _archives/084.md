    In the foreground a pristine can of baked beans sits in the dirt. Behind this, an arm sinks in the dirt up to the elbow and has small maggots crawling up it. In the background, a line of shopping bags gets progressively more rotten and decayed. The words “TMA 84 - Possessive” float in the top left corner.
