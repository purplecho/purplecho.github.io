alt: An old-looking camera with cracked lens atop a narrow surface. Behind it are grey skies, dark storm couds and lighting bolts. The only clear element in the picture is the lens, which shines through and stands out against the much darker elements.

There were many ways I could've illustrated this episode but I figured Salesa's camera, given how it became such an important element in later episodes, deserved a chance at the spotlight. I loved how the island where Salesa retrieved it from just fell into chaos with heavy rains and rolling storms as soon as he took it away. RIP Salesa u will be missed king
