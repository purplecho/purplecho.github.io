    A wooden crate with the word 'explosives' written on its front and the Magnus Institute owl symbol on the side. On top there is an open statement with an image projecting from it: a man laying in bed with a man sitting on a chair next to him. The seated man is sucking the life force from the sleeping man (depicted as dark strands connecting their mouths).
