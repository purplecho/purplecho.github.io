    A figure (the sandman) in darkness lurks in the background with shadows on all sides. Very little light exists besides a strip of it with tendrils curling through, to focus on a sack on the floor.

This is one of my favorite episodes. The statement itself has some of the best imagery ("I watched that moonlight curdle like rancid milk"), in addition to the pre and post statment moments having some of the most memorable interactions (Melanie poisoning Elias' coffee for one). Nothing I put down would live up to the mental image of the Sandman, but I couldn't resist trying.
