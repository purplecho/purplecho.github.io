    A dark space inside a shen-ring (a circle standing on a flat foot). In the right corner on a raised dais lies a sarcophagus. In the foreground lies a mummy, partially unwrapped. In both bony hands it holds a knife, pointing at its own chest and ready to strike.

The story of the mummy who wants to die but cannot continues to haunt me - it's beautiful and sad and despite the fact that the mummy is the "monster" of this story I feel mostly pity, despite the fact that it's still such a scary episode. It's one of my favourite episodes because I studies Egyptology and some obsessions will always be hard to shake. The first time I listened to the episode I was so scared, because all forms of un-dead zombie-like things scare me, and I wasn't expecting to feel sorry for the poor trapped mummy, stuck in its maze forever. Is it still there in s5? I hope it got out of that tomb (prison) at least, even if it cannot move on to the afterlife
