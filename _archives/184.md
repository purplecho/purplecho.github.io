i kid you not it took me 2 hours to do all the ants in this; i can remember distinctly thinking 'oh this is horrific! delightfu!' while listening to this one, the pleading for help and then the watcher chant turning jordan kennedy from the watched into the watcher of the domain, the actual statement of the hopeless pursuit for the one thing that you think will fix it all. very enjoyable experience to listen to
