    Breekon (left) and Hope (right). They are in front of, and largely obscuring, a pile of dead bodies and a cloudy sky. Breekon is covering his face with his right hand and smiling, while Hope has his left hand on Breekon&#x27;s shoulder and his face close to Breekon&#x27;s ear. Hope is wearing a plague victim&#x27;s face over his own like a mask, and has a scythe behind him.
