    Breekon (left) and Hope (right). The style evokes a medieval woodcut. They are in front of, and largely obscuring, a pile of dead bodies and a cloudy sky. Breekon is covering his face with his right hand and smiling, wearing a peasant&#x27;s cap and shirt. Hope has his left hand on Breekon&#x27;s shoulder, with his face close to Breekon&#x27;s ear. He is wearing a plague victim&#x27;s face over his own like a mask, covering a beard, and has a scythe behind him. He wears a black robe with the hood down.
