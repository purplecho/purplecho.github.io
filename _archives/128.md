alt: Breekon (left) and Hope (right). The style evokes a medieval woodcut. They are in front of, and largely obscuring, a pile of dead bodies and a cloudy sky. Breekon is covering his face with his right hand and smiling, wearing a peasant's cap and shirt. Hope has his left hand on Breekon's shoulder, with his face close to Breekon's ear. He is wearing a plague victim's face over his own like a mask. He has a beard and uncovered hair behind this, with a scythe behind him. He wears a black robe with the hood down.
