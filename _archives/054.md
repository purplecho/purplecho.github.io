I chose this episode mainly for the iconic line "I broke into Gertrude's flat." from our dear Archivist. However as an episode overall it has these hints that, later in the show, are revealed as a part of the bigger picture. As with most of Season 1 and Season 2, listening back to this episode with the knowledge I have now, it is very enjoyable to spot all of the clues I didn't notice at first.
