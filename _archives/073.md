The Dark's always been an interesting one for me. Used to be terrified of it when I was younger (I must admit that it doesn't take much for me to slip back into that unease, even now), and it's such a primordial fear. Its depiction in this episode... well, Basira's description of the scene in the basement still sticks with me.
