I had a total of three thoughts while first listening to this episode: a) ahhhhhh, b) *ahhhhhhhhh*, and c) AHHHHHHH. In all seriousness, between the style of the statement, the soundscaping, the answers to questions we've had for so very long, and the feeling that everything is finally coming together, this is one of my favourite episodes.
