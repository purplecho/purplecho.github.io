    The top left half is the quote: &quot;Exactly where they&#x27;ve always been, Martin. Watching over my Institute.&quot; Every letter with a loop contains an eye, except for the &quot;a&quot; in &quot;Martin&quot;. Bottom right is the Panopticon, with an elevated stone platform in the middle and three rows of gated prison cells surrounding it. There are several stick figures: one obscured by fog at the bottom of the platform, another climbing the platform steps, one sitting on the platform&#x27;s throne, and one with an eye above its head standing to the side. Diagonally dividing these halves is a kitchen knife with a broken blade featuring the word &quot;Panopticon&quot;.

"Exactly where they've always been, Martin. Watching over *my* Institute." is in our& top 3 favourite Magnus lines and made us drop the scarf we were knitting the first time we heard it.
