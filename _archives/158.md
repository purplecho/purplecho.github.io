    Bottom right is the Panopticon, with an elevated stone platform in the middle and three rows of gated prison cells surrounding it. A stick figure obscured by wisps of fog stands at the bottom of the platform, while another figure climbs the steps of the platform towards another figure is sitting on a throne. A final figure with an eye above its head stands in the bottom left. In the other half of the picture is the quote: &quot;Exactly where they&#x27;ve always been, Martin. Watching over my Institute.&quot; Every letter with a loop has an eye in it, except for the &quot;a&quot; in &quot;Martin&quot;. There are several stylised eyes around this. Diagonally dividing these halves is a kitchen knife with a broken blade with the word &quot;Panopticon&quot; on it.
