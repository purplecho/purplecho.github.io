    Four segments around a cassette labelled &quot;I Guess You Had To Be There&quot;. The segments are as follows: 75 pence in coins, with the words &quot;like a macchiato, or maybe not that much.&quot;; train tracks, and the words &quot;John Smith. Right. Okay. Good.&quot;; a Jack Russell Terrier and the words &quot;So I got out of the Spiral, and went to dinner.&quot;; and a spiderweb obscuring a closed door, with a spider below it, alongside the words &quot;It&#x27;s not how spiders normally are&quot;. The word &quot;Hello&quot; is obscured by fog in the bottom right corner.
