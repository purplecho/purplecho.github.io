    Four segments of equal size, with a cassette tape in the middle that faintly reads &quot;I Guess You Had To Be There&quot; on the label. The top left square contains 75 pence in coins, and the words &quot;... like, like a macchiato, or... maybe not that much.&quot; The top right square contains train tracks, and the words &quot;John Smith. Right. Okay. Good.&quot; The bottom left square contains the head of a Jack Russell Terrier wearing a collar with a medal in the shape of a heart and the letter J engraved upon it; and the words &quot;So I got out of the Spiral, and went to dinner.&quot; The bottom right square contains a spiderweb in the top left corner, obscuring a closed door, with a spider below it, and the words &quot;It&#x27;s not how spiders normally are...&quot; The word &quot;Hello?&quot; is barely visible in the bottom right corner, obscured by fog.
