    Four segments of equal size, with a cassette tape in the middle that faintly reads "I Guess You Had To Be There" on the label. The top left square contains 75 pence in coins, and the words "... like, like a macchiato, or... maybe not that much." The top right square contains train tracks, and the words "John Smith. Right. Okay. Good." The bottom left square contains the head of a Jack Russell Terrier wearing a collar with a medal in the shape of a heart and the letter J engraved upon it; and the words "So I got out of the Spiral, and went to dinner." The bottom right square contains a spiderweb in the top left corner, obscuring a closed door, with a spider below it, and the words "It's not how spiders normally are..." The word "Hello?" is barely visible in the bottom right corner, obscured by fog.
