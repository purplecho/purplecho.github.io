    Several pieces of text surrounded by tight swirls, like a storm cloud, takes up the top two-thirds of the page. The pieces of text read: &quot;how the hell did I end up having to save the world?&quot;,  &quot;Good luck John. I do hope you win, but I also hope it hurts.&quot;, &quot;Okay.&quot;, &quot;Can everyone please make it back home?&quot;, &quot;You owe me one, Gerry.&quot;, and &quot;Timothy Stoker, August 4th, 2017. Statement ends.&quot; Below this cloud is another piece of text, surrounded by blank space which just reads: &quot;I&#x27;m making a decision. I trust them.&quot;
