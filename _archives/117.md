    Several pieces of text surrounded by tight swirls, like a storm cloud, takes up the top two-thirds of the page. The pieces of text read: "how the hell did I end up having to save the world?",  "Good luck John. I do hope you win, but I also hope it hurts.", "Okay.", "Can everyone please make it back home?", "You owe me one, Gerry.", and "Timothy Stoker, August 4th, 2017. Statement ends." Below this cloud is another piece of text, surrounded by blank space which just reads: "I'm making a decision. I trust them."
