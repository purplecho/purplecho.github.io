I wanted this one for the quote, "maybe you just picked a bad god" - although I accidentally misquoted it in the art (worms for brains), I'll honour my iffy memory. This show has such powerful characters - not as in, they HAVE powers, but their character is a FORCE and it has been an incredible privilege to get to follow every single person's progression throughout thie narrative.
