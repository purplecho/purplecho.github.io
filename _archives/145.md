    The silhouettes of two women are caught in a web, facing away from each other with arched backs. The left figure has short hair and is facing a wall of eyes, the right figure has long hair and is facing black flame. The web below them contains the words &quot;maybe you just picked the wrong god.&quot;

I wanted this one for the quote, "maybe you just picked a bad god" ...and then got the quote wrong when I was drawing. This show has such powerful characters - not as in, they HAVE powers, but their character is a FORCE and it has been an incredible privilege to get to follow every single person's progression throughout the narrative.
