i can remember loving this episode so much when i first heard it, like the 'cooldown' from 39 with all the recounting etc, and waiting to hear what had happened to the characters I missed, especially sasha. when not!sasha started speaking i can remember audibly gasping at it. It was just such a good finale ep at the end of season one, which really set the tone that everything was really moving and becoming a threat now - that it wasn't returning back to like it was in the beginning because while the threat had changed it was still there, and i couldn't wait to start season 2 to hear what came next.
