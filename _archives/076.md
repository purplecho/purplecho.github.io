alt: "An embroidered gray scalpel with a bloody tip. In the upper right corner is a brief exchange: "Carnage" "Blood." "Yeah, blood." A small sketch of a green eye behind a black quill sits underneath the exchange. Another exchange sits in the bottom left: "I was actually a meme for a day or two. You...do know what a meme is don't you?" "YES, I KNOW WHAT A MEME IS". The bottom border is red."
