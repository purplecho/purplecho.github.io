    An embroidered gray scalpel with a bloody tip. In the upper right corner is a brief exchange: &quot;Carnage&quot; &quot;Blood.&quot; &quot;Yeah, blood.&quot; A small sketch of a green eye behind a black quill sits underneath the exchange. Another exchange sits in the bottom left: &quot;I was actually a meme for a day or two. You...do know what a meme is don&#x27;t you?&quot; &quot;YES, I KNOW WHAT A MEME IS&quot;. The bottom border is red.
