    The words &quot;statement ends&quot; is written in an oddly elaborate style, where it reads the same the right way up as it does upside down (an ambigram). The note also features spilled ink in the bottom left corner, and a question mark to the right.

...admission: this was drawn in advance. It's an ambigram, which means it reads the same upside down as it does when it's the right way up - both say "statement ends". The circularity seemed fitting. Because, sure, it's over... but is it ever really over?
