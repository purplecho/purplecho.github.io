alt: "A wedding invitation, framed with leaves and flowers, written in French. It reads: "Invitation. Benoît Maçon et X ont le plaisir de vous inviter à célébrér leur mariage." The second name in the invitation is smudged and cannot be read. The entire invitation looks dirty, smudged around the edges, and at the bottom is a beetle-like bug standing over the page."

The detail of Jon reading a statement that's written in French perfectly even though he doesn't know French is still one of my favourite details in S3, especially with how scared and shocked Jon sounds after he's finished reading the statement and realizes what he's just done. As for the wedding invitation, it just seemed to me like the best way to illustrate Benoît's horrifying yet blissful end.
