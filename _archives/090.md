    An open locker revealing the twisted form of a torso with a face stitched into its back. It has four arms and six hands: one holding a volleyball, one giving a thumbs up, one curled in a fist. A bag hangs in the main part of the locker and a box of gloves and two Sprits cans are on the top shelf.
