    From above a bulky spider silhouette reaches down, jaws spread. Below, are the words ‘CREATURE FEATURE’ all in black except for the letters forming ‘EAT’ within each word, which are red. The message ‘EAT EAT’ is directly in line with the spider’s jaws.

Eat Eat' / Spiders Are Eating, or Giant Spider arranges for a Creature Feature to bring half-remembered dreams of a spider never sated to grisly life. Rendered in the style of a 1960s movie poster to match "Kumo Ga Tabeteiru" as a mid-to-late-60s movie. Permanent marker, red marker, red pastel.
