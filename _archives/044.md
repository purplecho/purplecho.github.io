    An old-fashioned circus tent with striped fabric. In the entryway a dark figure stands, arms thrown upwards in welcome. Above the doorway, a sign in Russian reads Другой Цирк (Another Circus). Between the two tent peaks, a tightrope has a small figure balancing on it. The episode title is written above and below the tent.

i remember listening to this episode and thinking  "maybe this is just what russia is like?"  (i'm joking, of course!) - i really loved the unfinished tiger. i hope it made an appearance at the unknowing. really wanted to give the impression of height in this one - not sure i quite managed it, but but i do still love the idea of the tightrope stretched between the two tentpoles.
