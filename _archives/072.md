    A shop front with the window and door sealed and boarded up. Above this is a sign reading &quot;food&quot; in bold letters in the middle, and &quot;grill&quot; in smaller red letters on either side. The boards on the window and door have posters spread about on them, some of them with squiggles for writing, but others reading &quot;meat is meat&quot;.
