    A stone reading &quot;Robert Smirke 1835 - Balance &amp; Fear&quot; is in the centre, and behind it there are three corridors. The left corridor is made up of a big spider web, the middle contains the outline of a fire, and the right has a human figure cut off by the border. The drawing is done in black ink with crosshatch accentuating the corridors. Text in the upper left corner reads &quot;Ep35 Old Passages&quot;.

This was one of the first episodes that sparked a lot of discussion about the Fears and lead to some incredibly on point meta that was later verified in 111. Also I always love the Gerard Keay episodes.
