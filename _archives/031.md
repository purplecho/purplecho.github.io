    On the left, a deer-like animal head with a human eye is behind the barrel of a shotgun. The shotgun has &quot;HUNTERS&quot; written on it below the head. The right shows a human with sharp teeth, and eyes that glare and distort into a diamond. The text &quot;Tomorrow will be a good day for a RUN&quot; is written on top.

The use of the nursery song "A Hunting We Will Go" always stuck with me. I do enjoy a game of chase.
