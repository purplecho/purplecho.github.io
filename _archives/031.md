    On the left, a deer-like animal head with a human eye behind the barrel of a shotgun with "HUNTERS" written on it below the head. The right shows a human with sharp teeth and eyes that glare and distort into a diamond. The text "Tomorrow will be a good day for a RUN" is written from top left to bottom right.
