    There is a maypole in the distance with a women tied to it, screaming as fire engulfs her. People are gathered around the maypole, some praying, some cowering. The scene is overseen by a figure in the foreground: grossly disfigured, bursting apart as spores emerge and burst from her skin. The spores fall over the scene before her, like snow around the roaring fire of the maypole. Underneath the scene is the line "and she bloomed" in cursive.
