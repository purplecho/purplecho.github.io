    A distant maypole with a woman tied to it, screaming as fire engulfs her. People are gathered around her, some praying, some cowering. A figure in the foreground is grossly disfigured, bursting apart as spores emerge from her skin and fall over the scene before her like snow. Underneath the scene is the line &quot;and she bloomed&quot; in cursive.
