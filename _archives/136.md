    A cobwebbed human skull hanging in the air, suspended by a string tied to a hook set into the bone of the cranium. Its jaw dangles a small ways below it, similarly attached to the skull by two strings, resembling the mouth of a ventriloquist&#x27;s puppet. There is a web in the corner of the jaw.
