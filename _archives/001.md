    A pack of Marlboro Red cigarettes and a single, unlit cigarette laying on a cobblestone walkway. Slightly to its left is the beginning of a steep concrete staircase. The words 'Can I have a cigarette?' are written on them in all caps and slightly jittery letters. The walkway and staricase are lined by a stone wall made of red-brown bricks in the background.
