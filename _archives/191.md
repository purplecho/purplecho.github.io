    Two women (Georgie and Melanie) sitting on a bench with their backs to the viewer. One has her arm around the other. They are both looking at a giant fluffy cat (the Admiral), who gazes back down at them. The background is made up of a series of eyes.

No way was I going to pass up a chance to draw the Admiral. As of episode 195 I still have hope that he'll turn up, munch all the spiders, and then singlehandedly deal with the Eye, because he's just that powerful.
