alt: In the centre, Francis, wearing black with a light face, dances on a stage. Their arms, legs, and shoulders are controlled by strings, which lead up to the eight legs  of a gigantic spider, which perches above the stage curtain. It has a fuzzy abdomen and a light face. Its eyes are covered in dots. The background behind the spider is cross hatched, and the stage curtains are shaded with lines.
