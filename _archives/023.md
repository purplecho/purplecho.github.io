    A small coin pinched between thumb and forefinger drawn in brown ink lines like a historical engraving. Coin has words 'Für die Stille’ written in the round with raised letters between two rings of raised decorative bumps. Behind the coin a bookshelf is partially visible, with blank staring eyes carved at regular intervals.

I am haunted by the 'Für die Stille' coin and the grisly fate of the 2nd coin thief. Did the eyeless figure also come again for Albrecht von Closen, who stole the coin from the tomb of Johann von Württemberg in the first place? Was that coin of the Dark or the End, stilling the murmuring of the books on their shelves as long as it itself laid undisturbed? The marble bookshelf eyes became prominently creepy in the statement as soon as the apparent 'lid' of the coin is lifted. As the statement was a historical one from Jonah's era, and the coin in question even older (1279 per side not shown), I had fun mimicking a historical illustration technique (aged engraving print using walnut ink) with brown sharpie and strokes instead of fills.
