alt: "Two men in a loving embrace, touching foreheads. One of them is shorter with long, wavy salt-and-pepper hair, heavy stubble, an angular nose, darker skin and square glasses. The other is slightly taller, has short, curly ginger hair, round glasses, a light stubble, a fuller and rounder face and freckle-covered skin. The taller man is framing the shorter man's face with both of his hands and the shorter man has a hand on the back of the taller man's neck. They both have their eyes closed, gentle smiles, and an overall peaceful expression on their faces. On the bottom-right corner, the following words are written: "Don't FRET it. It's just NICE to see you LIKE THIS. [CLICK]""

As I was listening to this episode, trying to decide what to draw for it, I considered drawing tombstones, maybe the statue of an ominous-looking angel, perhaps even Upton House, but upon relistening to it I was reminded me of how many sweet, tender moments between Jon and Martin this episode had, and I decided to immortalize that in this illustration. This episode had several moments that truly showed us how, despite all the horrors around them, they would be okay as long as they have each other, and I think that's goshdarn beautiful.
