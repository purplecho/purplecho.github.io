    Two men touching foreheads, with peaceful expressions on their faces. The left is shorter with an angular face and long, dark hair. The right is taller with a rounder face and short, ginger hair and is framing the shorter man&#x27;s face in his hands. To the right is the phrase: &quot;Don&#x27;t fret it. It&#x27;s just nice to see you like this. [Click]&quot;

As I was listening to this episode, trying to decide what to draw for it, I considered drawing tombstones, maybe the statue of an ominous-looking angel, perhaps even Upton House, but upon relistening to it I was reminded me of how many sweet, tender moments between Jon and Martin this episode had, and I decided to immortalize that in this illustration. This episode had several moments that truly showed us how, despite all the horrors around them, they would be okay as long as they have each other, and I think that's goshdarn beautiful.
