This episode is so strange in how uncanny it is to draw me in. It was released on a really rough day of my life. Episode 69 (nice). Introduced my lovely lovely spider wife. But for the most part it called to me because I am getting my PhD studying the neuroscience of fear, so the subject of the episode drew my interest on a deeply personal level. Neat!
