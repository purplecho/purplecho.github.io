    Two shadowy figures stand over a desk. They are wearing caps with 'B' & 'H' on them. Their only visible feature is a single eye looking out from under the brims of their caps. On the desk a package is illuminated by a lamp. It is wrapped with string and has "RTS" stamped on it. In the background is a package trolley and some frames on the wall.
