    A corridor ending with a dark yellow door slightly off-center. A knobbly hand with long fingers is reaching out from behind the door. The floor is pale yellow with a black rug running into the wall. The right wall goes from red to blue to purple, with green lights near the ceiling and mirrors across the surface. The left wall is green and in large green letters reads "There's no left turns"

I picked this one because this episode is not only a great introduction to one of the most well-crafted characters (The Distortion, both Helen and Michael) and one of my favourite episodes, but I wanted the opportunity to try my hand at what my mind deemed "psychedelic corridor."
