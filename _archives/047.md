    A corridor ending with a dark yellow door with a long, knobbly hand reaching out from behind it. The floor is yellow and black, and the right wall is red, blue and purple, with green lights near the ceiling and mirrors across the surface. The left wall is green with large green letters that read, &quot;There&#x27;s no left turns&quot;.

I picked this one because this episode is not only a great introduction to one of the most well-crafted characters (The Distortion, both Helen and Michael) and one of my favourite episodes, but I wanted the opportunity to try my hand at what my mind deemed "psychedelic corridor."
