    A humanoid silhouette with blank, glowing eyes is leaning over a misshapen pile of meat, with a red hammer in hand. This figure has nails hammered into it at various points such as its back and the side of its head, as does the meat pile. They are surrounded by scratchy shadows that get deeper towards the corners of the note. Blanks spaces between these shadows indicate a light source behind the figure&#x27;s head.
name: "Nappi"
