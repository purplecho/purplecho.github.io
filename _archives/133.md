alt: An expedition map primarily rendered in green, with rivers in blue. A black dotted line shows Fawcett's route north to a spot labeled Dead Horse Camp, then to the east, where the trail cuts through triangular swaths of other maps - depicting geographic features from the expeditions of Franklin and von Toll - and turns into a circle.
