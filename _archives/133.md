    An expedition map with rivers marked in blue. A black dotted line shows Fawcett&#x27;s route: north to a spot labeled Dead Horse Camp, then eastward, and eventually ending in a circle. The trail cuts through triangular swaths of other maps, which depict geographic features from the expeditions of Franklin and von Toll.
