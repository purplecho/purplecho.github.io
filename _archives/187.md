    Escher-like hallways in an intentionally overwhelming and confusing multitude of colours and angles. At the top left, long fingers wrap around a door. The words &quot;CEASELESS WATCHER-&quot; are written in the centre at an angle, and a small figure appears to be falling away from it with a scream.

Helen!Distortion's corridors gone Escher with sudden gravity shifts. Jon is headed rapidly away from his objective of smiting the Distortion with a broken off "Ceaseless Watch-aaaaargh" trailing behind him. Rendered in colored pencil using close to half of a box of 50 different colors. This climactic confrontation was so vivid in my mind on listening that I was drawn to the challenge of trying to rend the increasingly unreal and uncanny in a pulsation of color and perspective shifts.
