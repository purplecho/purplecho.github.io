alt: A human skull cries white fog from empty eye sockets. It is held between two hands, and above it is the bottom half of a face cut off by the frame. The face has an unnaturally wide grin. One of the hands wears a ring with an eye on it.

Tingly episode. Jonah's messed up personal relationships. Elias's dramaticness. Cool title. It's such a hinge episode, there's Before 92 and After 92. Also human skulls are cool paperweights.
