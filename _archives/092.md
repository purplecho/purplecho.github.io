    A human skull crying white fog being held between two hands, below the bottom half of a face. The face has an unnaturally wide grin, and one of the hands wears a ring with an eye on it.

Tingly episode. Jonah's messed up personal relationships. Elias's dramaticness. Cool title. It's such a hinge episode, there's Before 92 and After 92. Also human skulls are cool paperweights.
