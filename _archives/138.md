    Several sheets of paper bear a letter from Jonah Magnus to Robert Smirke. The visible text reads: &quot;My dear Jonah, You will forgive me, I hope, for being so forward, but I feel I must break the silence that has...&quot; and then is largely unreadable. The text ends abruptly with a black inkstain. The words &quot;Jonah&quot; and &quot;the sky blinks&quot; are emphasised. There are shackles in the top left corner above the letter, and below this is a tape recorder.
