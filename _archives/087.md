    A disembodied head in a pentagonal wooden frame, suspended by four hooks and wires. The mouth is open in a scream and staring blankly at the figure in the foreground, whose back is to the viewer. This other figure is made of fabric and coming apart at the seams, which small bugs scurry out of. It is also wearing a cracked mask. The words “Uncanny Valley” float in the top left corner.

The imagery of the heads being peeled, and the revelation that they're still aware is bone-chilling. But more than that, the fact that the statement giver doesn't even notice the first time he's there is straight-up hilarious.
