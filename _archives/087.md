alt: "A disembodied head is hung in a pentagonal wooden frame, suspended by four hooks and wires. The mouth is open in a scream and blank eyes stare at the figure in the foreground. This figure is shown from the back, from the shoulders up. It is made of fabric that is coming apart at the seams, and small bugs scurry from these holes in the seams. It is wearing a cracked mask, and the words “Uncanny Valley” float in the top left corner."

The imagery of the heads being peeled, and the revalation that they're still aware is bone-chilling. But more than that, the fact that the statement giver doesn't even notice the first time he's there is straight-up hilarious.
