    A hospital heart monitor with several colourful readings (Sinus Rhythm, Respiration, Heart Rate, Temperature, Pulse, among others.) At the bottom of the screen, it shows that the alarm has been muted. The patient number is 0171801-A, and the patient name is SIMS, J. All of the readings on the monitor are at zero or flat, including those that would normally display real-time changes, indicating no activity - except that they have each split open to show the shape of an eye. Below rests a pair of police handcuffs.

googling hospital monitors and seeing that if he'd been hooked up to one it would only have showed that jon was definitely a dead person in every conceivable way was kind of weird - all the ones I found did not monitor brain activity. loved drawing the eyes in this - i think i managed to make it pretty spooky looking! also the cuffs. nasty man goes to jail
