    A hospital heart monitor with several colourful readings for patient &quot;SIMS, J&quot;. These readings are all at zero or flat, indicating no activity - except that they have each split open to show the shape of an eye. At the bottom of the screen, it shows that the alarm has been muted. Below this monitor rests a pair of police handcuffs.

googling hospital monitors and seeing that if he'd been hooked up to one it would only have showed that jon was definitely a dead person in every conceivable way was kind of weird - all the ones I found did not monitor brain activity. loved drawing the eyes in this - i think i managed to make it pretty spooky looking! also the cuffs. nasty man goes to jail
