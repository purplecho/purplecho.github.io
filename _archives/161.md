    A dark room with a window in the center, its curtains billowing outwards as if in a breeze. Outside the window, a giant green eye stares in. Its gaze is a visible searchlight, locked onto a tape recorder on a table beneath the window. Coming from the tape recorder are two little bubbles, one of a cake and one of a stapler.

Is the stapler more a reference to 162? Yes. Did I know how to represent any of Gertrude's tapes in this episode OR 162? No. Did I desperately want to include a reference to as much of the OG archives crew as possible? Yes, sue me. This episode made SUCH an impression on me, because I had prepared myself to be punched in one way (apocalypse) and then suddenly got punched in a totally unexpected way I hadn't prepared for (OG Archives crew) and it broke my heart clean in two. As soon as I saw this one on the list I had such a clear image of what I wanted it to be, so I had to grab it.
