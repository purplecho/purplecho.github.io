    A dark, green-tinted room with a window in the center. The curtains of the window billow outwards as if in a breeze. Outside the window, a giant green eye stares in. Its gaze is a visible searchlight, locked onto a tape recorder on a table beneath the window. Coming from the tape recorder are two little bubbles, one of a cake and one of a stapler.

Is the stapler more a reference to 162? Yes. Did I know how to represent any of Gertrude's tapes in this episode OR 162? No. Did I desperately want to include a reference to as much of the OG archives crew as possible? Yes, sue me.
