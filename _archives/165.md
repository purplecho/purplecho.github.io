    A carousel with six poles visible, each featuring a slightly distorted creature: the horse has sharp teeth and evil eyes, the bird and bat have too-small legs, the shape might be a person with no head and incorrect limbs, the pig is angry, and the person has an X covering their face. The word &quot;Revolutions&quot; is written above the carousel, and a disorienting quote from the episode loops all around it in red.

We got so carried away about how GOOD the writing is in the statement bit that we completely forgot about "Ceaseless Watcher, turn your gaze upon this wretched thing" until after we finished drawing the post-it. It's also the only episode we relistened to immediately after the end credits ended - just couldn't get enough of that prose.
