alt: "A carousel with six poles visible, featuring a horse, a bird, an undeterminable shape, a pig, a bat, and a person. All shapes are slightly wrong: the horse has sharp teeth and evil eyes, the bird and bat have too-small legs, the shape might be a person but doesn't have a head and its limbs aren't in the right place, the pig is angry, and the person has an X covering their face. The word "Revolutions" is written above the carousel, and a quote in red ink loops all around saying, "Your face is not your face is not your face around the curling carousel it twists in place to take from you and all the tattered stolen souls whose sense of me is swollen and distended into nothing.""

We got so carried away about how GOOD the writing is in the statement bit that we completely forgot about "Ceaseless Watcher, turn your gaze upon this wretched thing" until after we finished drawing the post-it. It's also the only episode we relistened to immediately after the end credits ended - just couldn't get enough of that prose
