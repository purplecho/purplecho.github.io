    A man (Oliver Banks) on top of a brick building, surrounded by darkness and illuminated from behind by a bright light. Tendrils creep up the side of the building, stretching towards him. The drawing is done in black charcoal, and there is a hint of red on the tendrils.

Dreamer was the first episode that made me go 'wait, hang on, this is REALLY GOOD'. I'm always a fan of dream weirdness, and the mental image of a still city covered in creeping tendrils and someone roaming it alone has never really left me.
