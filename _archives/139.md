    A fire fills up most of the space in reds, orange and yellow. In the middle, the silhouette of a woman seems to rise up from the flames, her hair fluttering dramatically upwards. At the bottom reads &quot;139 - Chosen&quot;

Okay so confession time. I mostly chose this ep cause I immediately knew how I wanted to draw it. But! I also think Agnes is neat. It's just kinda cute how she was the messiah of the Desolation and then felt just enough of a sliver of an emotion for this random guy who asked her out on a few dates for all their plans to go up in smoke (HAH). And she saved Ronald Sinclair at HTR! I mean, she did burn her boyfriend's face off, which was probably the least romantic flex I've ever seen, but I don't know. I still think she's cool.
