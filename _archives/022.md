    The Archivist&#x27;s desk with sheets of paper scattered across it, the word &quot;Colony&quot; visible on one page. There are pens, a tape recorder, a laptop with a brand label of &quot;worm&quot;, and a glass jar containing silver worms. Above the desk is a quote: &quot;maybe an inch long, with a silver segmented body that goes black at the end, almost like it&#x27;s been burned...&quot;
