alt: "The Archivist's desk. There are sheets of paper scattered on the desk, with straight lines to represent text; the word "Colony" is written on one of them. There are two pens, a tape recorder, a closed laptop with a brand label that says "worm", and a glass jar containing a dozen or so silver worms. Above the desk is a quote: "... maybe an inch long, with a silver segmented body that goes black at the end, almost like it's been burned...""
