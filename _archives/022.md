    The Archivist&#x27;s desk. There are sheets of paper scattered on the desk, with straight lines to represent text; the word &quot;Colony&quot; is written on one of them. There are two pens, a tape recorder, a closed laptop with a brand label that says &quot;worm&quot;, and a glass jar containing a dozen or so silver worms. Above the desk is a quote: &quot;... maybe an inch long, with a silver segmented body that goes black at the end, almost like it&#x27;s been burned...&quot;
name: "Salts&"
