    A turquoise armchair with a red and white cane leaning on it. To its left is an opening of a dark tunnel with green tins piled next to it. Taped on the wall are four pieces of paper: the Magnus Institute owl symbol, a blurry picture of Melanie and Georgie holding the Admiral, a poem with the title &#x27;light in the dark&#x27;, and a poem with the title &#x27;Redeem&#x27; and signed &#x27;Arun&#x27; on the bottom. Below is the quote &quot;&#x27;Careful, she’s very possessive of that chair.&#x27; &#x27;Oh sorry! Didn’t mean to sit on the prophet’s throne!&#x27;&quot;
