    An armchair with a cane leaning against it. Behind is a tunnel with tins piled next to it, and four pieces of paper on the wall featuring the Magnus Institute owl, a blurry picture of Melanie with Georgie and the Admiral, and two of Arun&#x27;s poems. Below is the quote &quot;&#x27;Careful, she’s very possessive of that chair.&#x27; &#x27;Oh sorry! Didn’t mean to sit on the prophet’s throne!&#x27;&quot;
