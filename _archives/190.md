    A turquoise armchair with a red and white cane leaning on it. To its left is an opening of a dark tunnel with green tins piled next to it. Taped on the wall are four pieces of paper: the Magnus Institute owl symbol, a blurry picture of Melanie and Georgie holding the Admiral, a poem with the title 'light in the dark', and a poem with the title 'Redeem' and signed 'Arun' on the bottom. Below is the quote "'Careful, she’s very possessive of that chair.' 'Oh sorry! Didn’t mean to sit on the prophet’s throne!'" 
name: "Ashes"
