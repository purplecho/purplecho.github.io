78 has one of the most lovely moments throughout the whole series, i think. as they journey through the endless processing line, martin continues to be kind and polite to everyone he bumps into, even knowing that they donâ€™t see, feel, or hear him. he continues to offer humanity and dignity to those others find unworthy or unimportant. it... honestly set a bar for the kind of person i want to be.
