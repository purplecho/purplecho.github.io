    A spiral of thick gray lines towards a central funnel framed with the words “Well, let it never be said that I do not dance the steps that I am assigned”, the final word curving to echo the funnel’s edge. Leading into the blackness at the funnel&#x27;s centre the writing continues: “Free Will is simply Ignorance.”

Weaver is an apt title for this episode's statement - the words are a web of manipulation, and I rendered them here as a funnel spider's web, a classic ambush predator's trap. Statement quotes incorporated: "Well, let it never be said that I do not dance the steps I am assigned" and "Free will is simply ignorance". The latter has a hypnotic pull towards the center of the trap, drawing the eye and attention down the webhole towards an unknown and likely terrible fate in the unseen Spider's jaws. Pencil lines for the webbing to match the silvery lines of web described in Guest for Mr Spider.
