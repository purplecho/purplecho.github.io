alt: "A spiral of thick gray lines towards a central funnel. Neat cursive frames the scene with the words “Well, / Let it never be said / that I do not dance / the steps that I am / assigned”, with the final word curving to echo the funnel’s edge. Circling the funnel and leading into the blackness inside the writing continues: “Free Will is simply Ignorance.”"

Weaver is an apt title for this episode's statement - the words are a web of manipulation, and I rendered them here as a funnel spider's web, a classic ambush predator's trap. Statement quotes incorporated: "Well, let it never be said that I do not dance the steps I am assigned" and "Free will is simply ignorance". The latter has a hypnotic pull towards the center of the trap, drawing the eye and attention down the webhole towards an unknown and likely terrible fate in the unseen Spider's jaws. Pencil lines for the webbing to match the silvery lines of web described in Guest for Mr Spider.
