alt: The words "When would you start to worry about the rain?" written in cursive, with emphasis on the "you". Underneath is a stylized kukri blade. Behind everything, a regular pattern of tight rain drops in shades of blue. Under the kukri, the pattern breaks and there is only splashes instead at the bottom of the image, as if the blade cut the rain off.

I’ve always found this episode very soothing and melancholic, with the dread slowly creeping through the rain and that haunting question, and I loved that the theme of “anchors” came at the forefront through a precious family member!
