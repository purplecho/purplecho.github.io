    The words &quot;When would you start to worry about the rain?&quot; written in cursive above a stylized kukri blade. Behind everything is a regular pattern of raindrops in shades of blue. Under the kukri the pattern breaks, and there are only splashes of rain as though the blade is blocking the drops.

I’ve always found this episode very soothing and melancholic, with the dread slowly creeping through the rain and that haunting question, and I loved that the theme of “anchors” came at the forefront through a precious family member!
