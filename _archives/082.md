    On the right is Elias Bouchard, with eyes floating around his head, and a red eye staring right at the viewer from his chest. On the left, upside down, is Calvin Benchley, with five stars across his body symbolising the bullets Daisy shot him with. She's represented by the daisy in the middle. The title of the episode cuts through the middle, separating the two figures.

Jonahlias is my favourite character so I really wanted to do a post-it of one of his statements (though they aren't really his, are they); Jonahlias is my favourite character, ok! Yeah, he's evil and it's cringe to like villains these days, but whatever, I love him. I just. Had to choose an ep where he's got a leading role so I had an excuse to draw him. Besides, I remember this episode got me all 'holy SH*T' because not only did this man beat a geriatric to death two episodes ago in the unexpected character twist of the century, now he could look in people's minds?? He had supernatural powers??? I had so many questions. Iconic. I enjoyed it so much to have a bad guy who actually succeeded in executing his master plan instead of it being foiled by protagonists who barely know what's going on. Refreshing! (Though, you know, it appeared the risk he took was calculated, but man, was he bad at math.) Incredibly fun and well-written villain. Smug little man. I can't shut up about him. Ben Meredith thank you so much for your service.
