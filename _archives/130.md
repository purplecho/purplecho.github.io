alt: A scene in the style of gnostic imagery depicting a ritual sacrifice. Centered in the image is a great pit, a mouth with sharp teeth is at the bottom. In the pit are three large piles of meat and bones with a large halo situated behind them. Above the pit on either side are small figures carrying meat. Two large haloed figures stand below, on either side of the pit. The one in the right is holding a piece of meat with blood dripping from protruding bones. The one in the left is holding a dead four legged animal.

I mean, who doesnâ€™t go buck wild for the god of flesh, bone, and blood being summoned under an old gnostic temple by feeding it truckloads of meat?
