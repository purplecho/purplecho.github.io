    A scene in the style of gnostic imagery depicting a ritual sacrifice. The focus is a great pit containing three piles of meat and bones, with a sharp-toothed mouth beneath them. On either side of the pit opening are small figures carrying meat. Bracketing the pit itself are two large haloed figures, the one on the left carrying a dead animal, the other holding a piece of meat dripping blood.

I mean, who doesnâ€™t go buck wild for the god of flesh, bone, and blood being summoned under an old gnostic temple by feeding it truckloads of meat?
