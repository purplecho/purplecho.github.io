alt: "A distorted and broken cathedral with an Escher-style staircase on the left edge. In the centre of the cathedral is an eye shaped window, with a green rose window as its iris. There is a diagonal eye in the sky behind the cathedral, and in the ground underneath it all a person is falling towards a brutal peer review"

I was enamored with the concept of "Escher ate a bad cathedral and threw up everywhere" when I first listened, and as an academic I got a lot of cathartic joy out of the statement itself.
