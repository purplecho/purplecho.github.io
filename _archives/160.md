    A view looking through a window towards eyes in the sky, and trees on the ground. The four panels of the window have the words &#x27;I OPEN THE DOOR&#x27;, with one word in each window pane. Above, through, and below the window are the words: &quot;Bring all that is fear and all that is terror and all that is the awful dread that crawls and chokes and blinds and falls and twists and leaves and hides and weaves and burns and hunts and rips and bleeds and DIES.&quot;
