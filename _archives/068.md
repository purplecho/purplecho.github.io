alt:  In the top left corner a man ("Private Amherst") salutes the viewer while standing in a grave. Across from him are multiple men digging  graves, with some filled back in. The text reads "I Am Such A Restless Man". Below is the book "The Tale of a Field Hospital" with a corrupted, nearly illegible cover, alongside several flies, three beds with sheets pulled over the bodies laying upon them, and at the bottom right a leg with a (cartoon-ish) bone portruding from the thigh.
