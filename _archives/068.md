    At the top a man (&quot;Private Amherst&quot;) salutes while standing in a grave, across from multiple men digging more graves and the phrase &quot;I Am Such A Restless Man&quot;. Below is the book &quot;The Tale of a Field Hospital&quot; with a corrupted, nearly illegible cover, alongside several flies, three beds with sheets pulled over the bodies laying upon them, and a leg with a bone protruding from the thigh.

I've read Tale of a Field Hospital, so this episode hit a weird place between reality and fiction when listening, and I was thrilled to try drawing something for it.
