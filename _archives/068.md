     In the top left corner a man (&quot;Private Amherst&quot;) salutes the viewer while standing in a grave. Across from him are multiple men digging  graves, with some filled back in. The text reads &quot;I Am Such A Restless Man&quot;. Below is the book &quot;The Tale of a Field Hospital&quot; with a corrupted, nearly illegible cover, alongside several flies, three beds with sheets pulled over the bodies laying upon them, and at the bottom right a leg with a (cartoon-ish) bone portruding from the thigh.

I've read Tale of a Field Hospital, so this episode hit a weird place between reality and fiction when listening, and I was thrilled to try drawing something for it
