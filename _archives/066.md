    A wooden crate. In the background are quotes in barely legible handwriting, with some words obscured by the crate or continuing off-page. &quot;... king back on it now, the thing I find h... elieve is how well I slept. ... a restful night&#x27;s sle... d I didn&#x27;t drea... e pain in my leg... t woke me. The... ll cramps drag... slowly from unco... I tried to shift th... more comfortable... sition under the... cover... I still tried, slow... one at a time, to move... every limb and part of my body, hoping desperately that one of them would pass out into the open air and reassure me I wasn&#x27;t trapped within that small wooden cube. But I could barely move any of them and it soon became appa... that my prison was indeed a sturdy wooden crate.&quot; The words &quot;trapped&quot; and &quot;a sturdy wooden crate&quot; are traced over in red biro.
