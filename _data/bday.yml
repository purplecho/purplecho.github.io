    <p>Insides: For the infinite patience I can personally attest to ([scratched out] maybe because of my shenanigans, maybe not; who's to say?), I wish you infinite happiness all the hopefully not infinite days of your life (immortality is a no go, trust me on this one).<br/>
    PS: I did paint the flowers<br/>
    Congrats, best of luck, warm regards, & the rest of those sappy sentimentalities,<br/>
