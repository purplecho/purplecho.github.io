Dear Autumn,

Happy Birthday! I hope you have a wonderful day full of everything you enjoy! Plenty of cuddles from Crookshanks and Poptart, and of course getting to unleash Belgrathor Swordhand on whatever scenario Bryn has lined up for Dungeons & Leopards. Your presence and efforts in this community help make it the wonderful place that it is.

Best wishes for an excellent birthday!

-Holly
