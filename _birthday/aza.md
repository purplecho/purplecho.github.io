Happy birthday Autumn! (correct spelling)

(washi tape of autumnal Totoros and soot sprites; important friends)

You are so cool and nice!

It's so good to know you're around, keeping a gentle but firm [eye] on the Rusty Qommunity. Thank you so much for DMing my first ever D&D game! Thanks to you it was welcoming, reassuring chaos & laughter. (full of crocodile wrasslin')

Wishing you all the best, and a not-too-weird autumn! (music notes, a doodle of Mae Borowski's face; nightmare eyes!)

Aza!
