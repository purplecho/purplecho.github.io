Cover: GLADIOLUS [SYMBOLIZES A STRENGTH OF CHARACTER, FAITHFULNESS, AND NEVER GIVING UP]

Insides: For the infinite patience I can personally attest to ([scratched out] maybe because of my shenanigans, maybe not; who's to say?), I wish you infinite happiness all the hopefully not infinite days of your life (immortality is a no go, trust me on this one).

PS: I did paint the flowers

Congrats, best of luck, warm regards, & the rest of those sappy sentimentalities,

Joe Spooky
