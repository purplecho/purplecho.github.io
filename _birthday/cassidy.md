Hey, Autumn!

Thank you so much for GM-ing the *Dungeons and Leopards* games and wrangling the chaos created by James Ross and the other guests (I’m still in awe that you managed to not break into pieces when faced with FOMO). The games have been an absolute delight to watch and a very cosy companion while crafting (when I’m not holding my face in my hands)! It’s also a pleasure to hear you stream with or just being on voice with Bryn or Frank; your anecdotes are always funny to listen to, the pets interruptions are adorable, and your hair ornaments are always top-notch.

Thank you and congratulation for all the things you’ve put into motion in RQO! Thank you for taking care of the community and being so chill and transparent when you’re modding!

So – Joyeux anniversaire / Happy birthday to you! I wish you an excellent day, many games involving queer mermaids and many other good things in this new year of existence! (+ many pets and cuddles to Crookshanks and Poptart!)
